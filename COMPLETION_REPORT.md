# SharpEye Project Completion Report

## Overview

This report documents the improvements made to the SharpEye Linux Intrusion Detection System, focusing on implementing previously missing modules to provide a comprehensive security monitoring solution.

## Newly Implemented Modules

We have successfully implemented the following critical modules that were identified as missing in the initial assessment:

### 1. File System Integrity Monitor (`file_integrity.py`)

A comprehensive file integrity monitoring system that:
- Tracks file modifications using cryptographic checksums
- Detects unauthorized changes to critical system files
- Identifies potential ransomware activity through file change patterns
- Monitors suspicious script additions and system binary modifications
- Provides real-time alerting for critical file system changes

### 2. Kernel Module Analysis (`kernel_modules.py`)

A deep kernel module inspection system that:
- Detects syscall table hooking attempts by malicious kernel modules
- Identifies rootkits through known signatures and behavioral analysis
- Monitors module loading/unloading for suspicious activity
- Detects hidden kernel modules and memory manipulation
- Provides comprehensive rootkit detection capabilities

### 3. Library Inspection (`library_inspection.py`)

A sophisticated shared library analysis module that:
- Detects library hijacking and hooking attempts
- Identifies malicious preloaded libraries through LD_PRELOAD monitoring
- Recognizes suspicious symbol modifications and function hooking
- Monitors critical system libraries for unauthorized changes
- Provides detailed analysis of binary hooking attempts

### 4. Privilege Escalation Detection (`privilege_escalation.py`)

A thorough privilege escalation detection system that:
- Identifies SUID/SGID binaries that could be exploited
- Analyzes sudo configurations for dangerous settings
- Detects Linux capabilities that could lead to privilege escalation
- Monitors for container escape vectors in containerized environments
- Provides comprehensive privilege escalation risk assessment

### 5. Log Analysis Engine (`log_analysis.py`)

An advanced log analysis system with correlation capabilities:
- Analyzes multiple log sources for security events
- Implements complex event correlation to detect sophisticated attacks
- Provides IP and user reputation tracking
- Detects log tampering and manipulation attempts
- Correlates events across the system for comprehensive threat detection

## Integration Improvements

All new modules have been carefully designed to integrate with existing components:

- **Coordinated Detection**: Modules share information to provide holistic security monitoring
- **Consistent Interface**: All modules implement a standard API for baseline creation, integrity checking, and continuous monitoring
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Modules use multithreading and optimized algorithms to minimize system impact
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each module includes detailed documentation of capabilities, configuration options, and detection methods

## Documentation Updates

The documentation has been significantly enhanced:

- Updated README.md with detailed feature descriptions
- Enhanced module_reference.md with comprehensive details for all new modules
- Added configuration examples for all modules
- Provided in-depth explanations of detection capabilities

## Conclusion

With the implementation of these modules, SharpEye is now a fully-featured Linux intrusion detection system that provides comprehensive security monitoring capabilities. The system can detect a wide range of security threats, from file system tampering to kernel-level rootkits, library manipulation, privilege escalation vectors, and sophisticated attacks visible through log analysis.

The improvements ensure SharpEye meets all the requirements outlined in the initial assessment and provides a robust security monitoring solution for Linux environments.
