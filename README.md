## Overview

**SharpEye** is a comprehensive Linux intrusion detection and system security monitoring framework designed by innora.ai. It employs advanced analytics, machine learning, and behavior-based detection to identify and alert on suspicious activities, potential compromises, and security threats in real-time.

### Key Features

#### Core Detection Capabilities
- **Advanced ML-Based Resource Analysis**: Detect anomalies in CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns using machine learning and time series analysis
- **User Account Security**: Identify unauthorized accounts, privilege escalations, and suspicious login patterns
- **Process Analysis**: Detect malicious and suspicious processes with behavioral analysis
- **Network Connection Monitoring**: Identify unusual network connections and data transfers
- **File System Integrity**: Verify system file integrity and detect unauthorized changes with robust checksum validation
- **Log Analysis Engine**: Correlate events across multiple log sources to detect sophisticated attack patterns
- **Scheduled Task Inspection**: Identify malicious cron jobs and scheduled tasks
- **SSH Security**: Monitor SSH configuration and detect unauthorized access attempts
- **Kernel Module Analysis**: Detect malicious kernel modules, rootkits, and syscall table hooking
- **Library Inspection**: Identify dynamic library hijacking attempts and detect malicious preloaded libraries
- **Privilege Escalation Detection**: Find and alert on potential privilege escalation vectors including SUID binaries, capabilities, and dangerous sudo configurations

#### Enterprise Features (New)
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: ML-based anomaly detection with pattern matching for APT, ransomware, and cryptominers
- **Behavior Monitoring**: Real-time system behavior analysis with automatic baseline learning
- **Container Security**: Docker and Kubernetes security scanning with vulnerability detection
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: MISP, AlienVault OTX, and Mandiant threat feed integration
- **Real-time Alerting**: Multi-channel alerts via Email, Slack, Webhook, and Syslog
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface with WebSocket updates and responsive design
- **Attack Chain Analysis**: Graph-based correlation to identify multi-stage attacks
- **ML-Based Cryptominer Detection**: Identify unauthorized cryptocurrency mining with machine learning

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgInnora/sharpeye.git
cd sharpeye
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a full system scan
sudo sharpeye --full-scan

# Run a specific module
sudo sharpeye --module network

# Establish baseline for future comparison
sudo sharpeye --establish-baseline

# Compare against baseline
sudo sharpeye --compare-baseline

# Start with web dashboard (new)
sudo sharpeye --full-scan --web

# Run behavior monitoring
sudo sharpeye --module behavior

# Run container security scan
sudo sharpeye --module container_security
```

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `/etc/sharpeye/` after installation. Edit `config.yaml` to customize scan parameters and detection thresholds.

## Requirements

- Linux-based operating system (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, etc.)
- Python 3.6+
- Root privileges for comprehensive scanning
